In this analysis, I hope to compare the differences in these temperatures in order to establish a more comprehensive understanding of temperature fluctuations, as well as note common trends in the area.

        "After analysis, the trend in minimum and maximum temperatures in State College for 2019 proved to be quite different. There was more of a normal peak when looking at average maximum temperatures whereas the minimum temperatures had a few constant months where the lowest temperature stayed the same if not very close in range. Overall, maximum temperatures fluctuated the most last year and lower temperatures stayed rather consistent."
